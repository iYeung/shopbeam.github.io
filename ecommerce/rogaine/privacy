Policy;</li>	<li>		<b>to a third party in the event of</b> any reorganization,

we are required to do otherwise under applicable law (for example, if we are
required to treat such information as personal information). In addition, we may
use and disclose information that is not in personally identifiable form for any
purpose. If we combine information that is not in personally identifiable form
with information that is (such as combining your name with your geographical
location), we will treat the combined information as personal information as
long as it is combined.</p><p>	<b>Disclosures - Use of Service
Providers</b></p><p>	We may transfer personal information to outside agents or
service providers as described above. Some of these service providers may be
located outside of Canada, including in the United States. While outside of
Canada, your personal information will be subject to applicable foreign legal
requirements, which may include lawful requirements to disclose personal
information to government authorities in certain circumstances. We take
contractual or other means to ensure that your personal information that may be
collected, used, disclosed, accessed, stored or otherwise processed by the
service provider on our behalf is protected and not used or disclosed for
purposes other than directed by us, subject to legal requirements in foreign
jurisdictions applicable to those organizations.</p><p>	Please refer to the
CONTACT US access, change, or delete section below in order to find out how to
obtain access to written information about our practices with respect to:
disclosures and/or service providers outside of Canada and the title of the
person who is able to answer, on behalf of JJI, questions you may have about a)
the service providers outside Canada who may collect, use, disclose, access,
store your personal information, b) the purposes for collecting, using,
disclosing, accessing or storing your personal information, or c) where
information will be held or the categories of persons who will have access to
it.</p><p>	<b>Other Disclosures</b></p><p>	We may also disclose your personal
information in other circumstances with your consent.</p><p>	<b>THIRD PARTY
SITES AND SERVICES</b></p><p>	This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are
not responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices of any third
parties, including any third party operating any site or web property
(including, without limitation, any application) that is available through a
Site or to which this Site contains a link. The availability of, or inclusion of
a link to, any such site or property on a Site does not imply endorsement of it
by us or by our affiliates.</p><p>	<b>SECURITY</b></p><p>	We use reasonable
organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect personal
information under our control. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the
Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have
reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for
example, if you feel that the security of any account you have with us has been
compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in
accordance with the &quot;<i>Contact Us</i>&quot; section
below.</p><p>	&nbsp;</p><p>	<b>CHOICES, CONSENT AND ACCESS</b></p><p>	<b>Your
choices regarding our collection, use and disclosure of your personal
information:</b></p><p>	Consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your
personal information may be given in various ways. Consent can be express
(express consent may be oral, in writing or electronic), implied (such as when
you provide your name and address in order for us to send you products or
information you have requested) and may be given by your authorized
representative (such as a legal guardian or a person having a power of
attorney). Generally, by providing us with your personal information, we will
assume that you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of such
information as described in this Privacy Policy, if applicable, or as otherwise
identified at the time of collection.</p><p>	We give you choices regarding our
collection, use and disclosure of your personal information for marketing
purposes. In some cases you will, at the point of collection of the information,
be given the option to &quot;opt in&quot;. The act of &ldquo;opting in&rdquo;
constitutes your express consent to receive future communications that may be of
relevance to you. You can provide your express consent to our collection, use
and disclosure of such information by checking a box on a form, clicking on a
specified icon on a web site, or by doing some other specified express action
such as contacting us by telephone or by e-mail, or by signing a consent form on
which your personal information is requested. Your personal information will in
such case only be collected, used or disclosed for the purposes we describe at
that time if you &quot;opt in&quot;. You will, for example, have the option to
&quot;opt in&quot; to receive information about, or special offers for, the
products of JJI, in which case you will receive information relating to those
brands and programs of JJI that we believe may be of interest to you. By
&quot;opting in&quot; to offers from JJI, you are indicating your agreement to
automatically receive communications regarding any brands or programs of JJI
that we believe will be of interest to you. Alternatively, for certain brands or
specific programs, where offered, if you wish to receive information relating
<u>only</u> to specific brands <u>and</u> related programs or <u>only</u> to
specific programs, you will have the option to &quot;opt in&quot; separately for
these. After you &quot;opt in&quot; to receive offers or programs, you will have
the option to &quot;unsubscribe&quot; or withdraw your consent if you no longer
want to receive communications, either by following the instructions in an
e-mail we send you or by contacting us by other means, as described
below.</p><p>	It is currently our policy, when collecting personal information
that will be input into the JJI consumer database, to only use that information
for the purpose(s) identified at the time of collection as described above.
Unless you have indicated that you wish to receive specific program or brand
information the information you provide will not be used to send you offers and
communications outside of the initial interaction (e.g. registration, trial
offer, contest, or coupon request).</p><p>	When you wish to participate in a
promotion, contest or survey, engage or participate in discussions, promotions
or otherwise interact on our web sites, or to purchase a product you will not be
required, as a condition of your participation or purchase of the product, to
provide more personal information than is necessary or legally required in order
for us to administer the promotion, contest or survey, facilitate the discussion
or to deliver any products you may be entitled or wish to receive. However, you
may be provided with the option of providing additional personal information.
You may, for example, choose to provide additional personal information by
completing a questionnaire on a contest ballot or a personal profile relating to
your use of our products or provide household information, in which case we may
then use that information to assist us in developing, improving, and selling our
products or improve your interactions on our web sites.</p><p>	If you have
provided us with personal information and wish to withdraw your consent to its
retention, use or disclosure, you may opt out from receiving marketing
communications from us. If you no longer want to receive marketing
communications from us on a going-forward basis, you may opt out of receiving
them by: either following the unsubscribe instructions provided within any
marketing communication; or by contacting us via the methods described below. In
your response to us, please provide your name, identify the form(s) of marketing
communications that you no longer wish to receive, and include the address(es)
to which it/they are sent. For example, if you no longer wish to receive
marketing e-mails or direct mail from us, tell us that, and provide your name
and e-mail or postal address. In any case, we will seek to comply with your
request(s) to unsubscribe from marketing communications as soon as reasonably
practicable in accordance with applicable privacy
laws.</p><p>	&nbsp;</p><p>	<b>CONTACT US</b></p><p>	You may contact us as
